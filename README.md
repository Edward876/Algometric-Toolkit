## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture using React components:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/         # Static assets like images and icons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SortingVisualizers/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DPVisualizers/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeVisualizers/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/          # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions and algorithm implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/        # React Context API implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/         # Global styles and theme definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx         # Main application component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.jsx        # Entry point
```

### Component Architecture

Each algorithm visualizer follows a similar structure:

1. **Controller Component**: Manages the state of the visualization.
2. **Visualization Component**: Renders the actual visualization.
3. **InfoPanel Component**: Displays information about the current step.
4. **CodeView Component**: Displays the algorithm implementation.

## üíª Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with hooks and context API
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Styled Components with CSS animations
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Code Highlighting**: Prism.js
- **Icons**: Font Awesome

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Code Splitting**: Components are loaded on demand using React's lazy loading.
2. **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo are used to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
3. **Virtualization**: For large datasets, virtualization is used to render only the visible elements.
4. **Web Workers**: Intensive computations are offloaded to web workers to prevent UI freezing.
5. **Efficient Animations**: Animations are optimized using CSS transforms and opacity.

## üé® Customization

### Theming

The application uses a cyberpunk theme by default, but the styling can be easily customized:

1. **Color Scheme**: Edit the theme variables in `src/styles/theme.js`.
2. **Animations**: Modify animation parameters in the Framer Motion components.
3. **Fonts**: Change the font families in the global CSS.

### Adding New Algorithms

To add a new algorithm visualization:

1. Create a new component in the appropriate directory.
2. Implement the algorithm in `src/utils/algorithms/`.
3. Add a new route in `App.jsx`.
4. Add a new entry in the navigation menu.
